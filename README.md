# Amazon Bedrock Code Examples

This repository contains code examples that demonstrate how to use the [AWSK SDKs](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/) to interact with [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/de/bedrock/).

You can find more examples in the [Amazon Bedrock User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/service_code_examples.html) and the [Generative AI space on community.aws](https://community.aws/code/generative-ai).
